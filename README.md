## Description

My main goal while doing this project was to made fully functional website that would be good looking representation of my CV. I tried to make it SPA so the website has two components - polish and english. I also wanted to learn something about Bootstrap so I used some of it's components like carousel.

Website itself contains of a few segments. You can move between them using arrow keys on keyboard, arrow buttons on the left and rigth sides of screen or buttons at the bottom. To change language use buttons in the top left corner. At the bottom right corner are icons redirecting to my github and linkedin.
